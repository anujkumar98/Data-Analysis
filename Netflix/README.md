The  **"Netflix Data Analysis on Tableau"** project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset of Netflix content. The dataset includes information such as show ID, type (movie or TV show), title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed genres, and description.

The project aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of Netflix content over time, across different countries, genres, and ratings. To achieve this, the project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create interactive dashboards and visuals.

## Visuals Included
The following visuals are included in the project:

- **No of titles per year:** A line chart showing the number of new titles added to Netflix each year, allowing the user to see how the content library has grown over time.
- **Total movie & TV shows count by country:** A map view showing the total number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix in different countries, allowing the user to compare the content available in different regions.
- **Top Genre in a tree map:** A tree map showing the most popular genres of content on Netflix, with larger boxes representing more popular genres.
- **Movies & TV shows by rating in packed bubbles:** A packed bubble chart showing the distribution of movies and TV shows by rating, allowing the user to see how much content falls into each rating category.

## Interactive Filters
The project includes interactive filters that enable users to explore the data in greater detail. Users can filter the dataset by the following criteria:

- **Release year:** Filter by the year a title was released on Netflix.
- **Country:** Filter by the country where a title is available on Netflix.
- **Genre:** Filter by the genre of a title.
- **Rating:** Filter by the content rating of a title.

Upon applying a filter, the project dynamically updates the visuals and shows cards containing additional details about each title. These details include duration, cast, genre, and description, enabling users to gain a deeper understanding of the selected titles.

Overall, the "Netflix Data Analysis on Tableau" project provides a comprehensive exploration of the Netflix content library, with interactive visuals and filters to help users gain insights into the trends and patterns of the data.
